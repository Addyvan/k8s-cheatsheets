# Exam prep tips

* Use the documentation found at kubernetes.io to achieve tasks as it is the only resource allowed during the exam.
* Know your Linux - specifically how the systemmd service runs and operates, how to troubleshoot problems and basic commands.
* Know your way around the kubectl command, the help outputs for each option are invaluable. 
* Answer exactly what the question asks you - if you are asked to create a Pod, then create a Pod.
* Be well versed in grep, systemctl, journalctl (with its options) as there are many questions which require you to view logs. For journalctl the "-l" and "-no-pager" options are apparently useful.
